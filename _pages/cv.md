Education
======
* B.Sc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engr and Tech (BUET), 2013
* M.S in Electrical Engineering, Northeastern University, USA, 2016
* Ph.D in Electrical Engineering, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA, 2022 (expected)

Work experience
======
*Power, Energy and Intelligent Systems Lab (PEISL) Aug. 2019 – Present*
Graduate Research Assistant, UNCC, Charlotte, USA
• Developed a SOCP OPF model for single-phase and three-phase radial power distribution networks with high DGs
penetration. The proposed convex OPF model also retrieves the bus voltage angle difference.
• With the retrieved angle difference information, the proposed model provides an exact solution to the AC-OPF problem
for mesh networks satisfying the cyclic constraints in a network.
• Proposed a new control algorithm for Voltage Control of power distribution system with inverter-based distributed
generation.
• Designed and implemented a hardware test system for different experiments on smart-grid operation and control.
